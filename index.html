        <p>  Make a marinade by mixing chopped garlic, freshly squeezed lemon juice, ketchup, lemon-lime soda, sugar, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, oyster sauce, ground ginger, kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper. Reserve some for glazing later, and pour the marinade over the chicken thighs in a zip-top bag. Marinate for at least 5 hours or overnight.  Once the chicken is marinated, take it out and roast the chicken over a parchment-lined baking sheet over a wire rack. Roast at 400ºF for 30 minutes.

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook, covered, until the rice is tender and all the water has been absorbed.Combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a separate saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved.Allow the vinegar mixture to cool, then stir it into the cooked rice. Stir until the rice is nice and sticky — it'll look wet at first, but it'll dry as it cools.Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat. </p> </div>
